# Fizzi Website - Final code

This is the final code for a 3D animated e-commerce landing page for the fictional soda brand, Fizzi!


## Just a Landing Page

Was feeling boredom, so decided to code and give it a try to Next js, GSAP. It was made way back when i started to learn next js but i uploaded code late to Github, as I didnt remember. to push my code.



1. Clone the code:
    
    ```tsx
    npx @slicemachine/init@latest --starter course-fizzi-next
    ```
    
2. Download the dependencies
3. Run the content set up script:
    
    ```tsx
    npm run dev
    ```
    
4. Open the terminal. A URL will be printed on the screen.
5. Enjoy the beautiful website.
